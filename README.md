#Open Boundaries

- this is the repo for working on developing a set of principals for an "ideal" open global sub-national boundary data set
- principles and ratings for existing data sets are separated out into JSON files to separate markup editing/design from actual modifications to the proposed set of principles
- still need to work on the principles themselves
- if you are interested in working on this, shoot me a note and i'll add you as a collaborator

##TODO

- come up with a good draft set of principles
- come up with some prose explaining why this is important
- improve website design
- come up with a list of existing datasets which we can eventually rate
- rate available datasets
